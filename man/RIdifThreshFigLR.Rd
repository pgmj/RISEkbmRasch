RIdifThreshFigLR(dfin, dif.var)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfin}{Dataframe with item data only}

\item{dif.var}{DIF variable}

}
\details{
Makes use of the eRm package function \code{LRtest()}. Outputs a panel of figures
with item threshold locations and 95\% confidence intervals.

DIF variables need to be factors with the same length as the number of rows
in the dataset.
